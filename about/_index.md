My first developer role was as a part-time web developer for my alma mater using primarily PHP.
My first project with Java was during this role and was a very satisfying developer experience.

After three fulfilling years in the non-profit space, I decided in late 2018 to return to a
full-time career in software engineering.

Currently a full-time Java developer but in June 2020 I started playing with the Go programming
language.

During this period of developer history, this career path has much potential for people with
lower levels of education to raise their income while doing something they find enjoyable.
Consequently, I am a huge advocate for positively encouraging people who are interested in
the field by freely sharing what I know and cheering on beginners applying for work. Especially
people from underserved backgrounds and people looking for a career switch. 

From late 2019 to mid 2020 I volunteered as a leadership team member for
[FaithTech Chicago](https://faithtech.com/cities/chicago/), and currently volunteer for the
[Chicago Java Users Group (CJUG)](https://cjug.org/).

Being a follower of Jesus is by far the most important thing to me. He has given me the
second chance at life that I didn't deserve, and He offers it freely to all. If you are
curious to learn more about what this means, feel free to hit the Contact page and drop
